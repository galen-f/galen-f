# 👋 Hi, I’m Galen Ferrara!

I'm a first-class Computer Science graduate with a passion for elegant design and complex problem solving. I build intuitive interfaces, design software with purpose, and write clean code thats both human and machine friendly.

## 🎯 Interests
- **Quantitative Development**: I have a degree in mathematics and an active interest in quantitative finance, I'm exploring how analytical models and algorithmic logic can shape financial tools.
- **UI/UX**: I believe thoughtful and user oriented design is what seperates good software from great software. I have a stong passion for understanding HCI principles and how UI design can influence smartphone addiction, and the benifits of minimalist UI design.
- **System-Level Thinking**: Whether it's building IoT systems, designing Android launchers, or simulating trading platforms in C++, I enjoy thinking through how components interact across layers of abstraction.
